# Understanding Julia language

This repository has some applications about how runs Julia. Here I created a hello world and a calculator to understand how run Julia.

## How run it?

```bash
$ julia calculadora.jl 
```

You will see a menu as it:

```bash
Please, select an option
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
q -> Exit
```

When you select an option(e.g 1) and press enter and you should write the numbers and press enter. You will see the response:

```bash
Please, select an option
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
q -> Exit
1
Number 1: 3
Number 2: 5
****************
Response: 8
****************
```

To exit you should write `q` and press enter.
